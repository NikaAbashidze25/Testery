- Background color: Off-white (#F5F5F5), nearly desaturated from the primary hue to keep it calm and professional.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) for highlights and calls to action, a color of clarity and precision that contrasts in brightness with the primary, while still matching the overall sense of digital professionalism.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font with a modern and neutral aesthetic, will be used for the site.
- Use professional, consistent icons for job categories, skills, and user actions.
- A clean, card-based layout to present job listings and user profiles clearly.
